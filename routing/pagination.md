# Pagination

[&larr; Home](../README.md)

***

Laravel's paginator is integrated with the query builder and Eloquent ORM and provides convenient, easy-to-use pagination of database records with zero configuration.

By default, the HTML generated by the paginator is compatible with the Tailwind CSS framework; however, Bootstrap pagination support is also available.

Documentation: [https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pagination](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pagination)

Pagination can be accomplished through Laravel by using either the Query Builder or Eloquent Model structures. 

### Using Query Builder

In the example below, we are using Query Builder to access the users table and return an object of records ready for pagination.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
 
$users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);

// Sometimes you just need "Next" & "Previous" buttons
$usersSimple = DB::table('users')->simplePaginate(15);
```

### Using Eloquent Models

In the example below, we are using an Eloquent Model to access the users table and return an object of records ready for pagination.

```php
use App\Models\User;
 
$users = User::paginate(15);
```

### Displaying Pagination

In either case, you can use blade to render the pagination.

```php
<div class="container">
    @foreach ($users as $user)
        {{ $user->name }}
    @endforeach
</div>
 
// This will render the pagination, defaults to using Tailwind CSS
{{ $users->links() }} 
```
